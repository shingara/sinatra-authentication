a little sinatra gem that implements user authentication

INSTALLATION:

in your sinatra app simply include "sinatra-authentication" and turn on session storage
with a super secret key, like so:

    require "sinatra-authentication"

    use Rack::Session::Cookie, :secret => 'A1 sauce 1s so good you should use 1t on a11 yr st34ksssss'

DEFAULT ROUTES

- get      '/login'
- get      '/logout'
- get      '/signup'
- get/post '/users'
- get       '/users/:id'
- get/post  '/users/:id/edit'
- get       '/users/:id/delete'

If you fetch any of the user pages using ajax, they will automatically render without a layout

HELPER METHODS

This plugin provides the following helper methods for your sinatra app:

- login_required
which you place at the beginning of any routes you want to be protected
- current_user
- logged_in?
- render_login_logout(html_attributes)
Which renders login/logout and singup/edit account links.
If you pass a hash of html parameters to render_login_logout all the links will get set to them.
Which useful for if you're using some sort of lightbox

SIMPLE PERMISSIONS

By default the user class includes a method called admin? which simply checks
if user.permission_level == -1.

you can take advantage of  this method in your views or controllers by calling
current_user.admin?
i.e.

  - if current_user.admin?
    %a{:href => "/adminey_link_route_thing"} do something adminey

(these view examples are in HAML, by the way)

You can also extend the user class with any convenience methods for determining permissions.
i.e.

  #somewhere in the murky depths of your sinatra app
  class User
    def peasant?
      self.permission_level == 0
    end
  end

then in your views you can do

  - if current_user.peasant?
    %h1 hello peasant!
    %p Welcome to the caste system! It's very depressing.

if no one is logged in, current_user returns a GuestUser instance, which responds to current_user.guest?
with true, current_user.permission_level with 0 and any other method calls with false

This makes some view logic easier since you don't always have to check if the user is logged in,
although a logged_in? helper method is still provided

# Configuration

set :user_model_path, 'user_activerecord.rb'
